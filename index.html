    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
      <p>Yes! Yes it is, hello my name is Mario. I am 46 yrs old and I have one son.
      I am getting married in September and my fiance has two daughters so my family will
      be growing in a interesting and new way.</p>

      <p>I am getting married and staying in a tree house for two days. It sounds better than
        it is, if you have ever seen the tv show Tree House Masters they have a bed and
        breaskfast in Issaquah with seven tree houses.</p>

      <p>I was in the navy on submarines and my longest time out at sea without seeing
      the sun was 89 days.</p>

      <p>Jeep Wranglers are awesome, I have been driving mine for over 22 years and
      hopefully I can drive it for some years to come.</p>

      <p>I love to travel, in the past two years I have gone to Amsterdam, Rome, Chicago,
      Hawaii and Vancouver BC.</p>
